    "### Why? - is this important\n",
    "\n",
    "Many companies hiring data scientists often require candidates to have PhD or masters in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subject largely, in my opinion, based on the fact students who graduate in these subjects will have had rigorous training in deriving mathematical theories and solving complex problems. While these skills are undoubtedly applicable to data science, this is just small part of the modern data scientists toolbox with arguably communication and...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science projects are inheritantly researched based given that a large chunk of work is exploring data, building models and seeing what works and what doesn't. However, if the project is not clearly defined then it can to lots of work done, but no results or product to show for your hardwork. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data science has been adopted at a expontial rate over the last 15 years and as a result there is a large amount of data iliteracy in key decision-making parts of businesses leading to misaligned of expectations of what data science is, what probelems it can solve and what it takes to implement at scale. This can result in angry exectives disillusioned by the ability of data science and frustrated developers unable to complete the work they were hired to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who? - should care\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure expectations are managed, it is the job of a data scientist to clearly define a project so that the exact purpose of the project can be unamibiously set and key objectives agreed to achieve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What? - is the solution I offer\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how issues can be avoided I'm going to walk through the PPDAC (Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, Conclusion) method as outlined in The Art of Statistics by David Spiegelhalter. This process complements the iterative nature of the data science life cycle and shows that by taking a problem first approach, we can create results for any data science project.\n"

    "Understanding and defining the problem. How do we go about answering this question? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the data, it's important to frame your problem as one that can be solved using data science - specifically machine learning. The difficulty of your task can vary wildly depending on how you frame it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using a dataset from the World Bank which details all contract awards financed by The World Bank under Investment Project Financing (IPF) operations. Suppose you work for a contractor who has recently heard about machine learning and is keen to adopt it witin the business to help increase revenue. There are a number of things to scope out. Firstly, what is the problem here? Your boss wants to increase revenue and a good way to do that is the analyse contract prices to assess how we would save costs by increasing pricing accuracy. Secondly, what has been done before? Is there work already done to price contracts? If so then can that solution be used or built upon? Thirdly, can this be defined as a machine learning problem? In this case, because we are trying to estimate price, a continuous variable, we can frame this as a regression problem. "

    "What to measure and how? Study design? recording? collecting?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to skip the planning stage of a project and go straight to exploring the data and building models, but there are several things to consider before getting to the fun part.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Project objective. It is vital to agree on what the objective is so everyone involved, developers to stakeholders, understand what we're trying to accompolish. In this use case, we want to estimate contract prices accurately within a 5% margin of error (this figure can vary depending on the project), and understand the most important features in estimating contract prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose a metric to optimise. Now that we know our objectives, we can choose a performance metric to optimise. As this is a regression task we will use either Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - depending on the distribution of contract prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data collection. Collecting the right data is arguably the most important part for developing predictive models so identifying the data needed, the data sources, and identifying potential limitations early will prevent future delays. For the purpose of this article, we already have a dataset, but in real projects it is vital to acquire as much data as possible and consult with industry experts to understand what features are important, and to address how to clean the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Resource management. Depending on the size of the task the amount of compute power, personnel and time will vary. Therefore, identifying these issues early will save time downstream. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Methodology. This stems from defining the task and the metric we want to optimise allowing us to identify the tools needed for the project to be successful. Considerations include:\n",
    "- What Python packages to use?\n",
    "- Do we need to use ML? Is there a simpler method? \n",
    "- What model training method will we use? \n",
    "- What models should we utilise?\n",
    "- How should we interpret feature importances?\n",
    "- How will we communicate our results? \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Identiyfing potential risks. As suggested previously, risks can arise around insufficient data, lack of resources to complete task, and poor model performance. It is important to flag these early so stakeholders are aware to keep the scope of the project realistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Ethical considerations. Perhaps the most important question when using data and machine learning is to ask whether you should at all. It's important to consider the consequences of your analysis and whether there will be any negative impact on society. Hence, removing features that introduce bias such as gender, using appropriate modelling techniques to remove your own bias, and creating transparency about the model and data used are all are some of the essential considerations when planning for your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Reliability & maintainability. The reliability of a model is paramount to deciding if your prediction is wrong, how do you know? Correct code documentation and reproducibility means agreeing on what coding standards everyone in your team should adhear to, and following data and model versioning to increase tracibility of your analysis. \n",
    "Examples of coding practices include:\n",
    "- Documentation - Following PEP 257, adding README.md to project repo, adding docstrings for modules, classes and functions\n",
    "- Coding Standards - using formatters such as Black, consistent naming conventions (I use snake_case for functions and PascalCase for classes), using type hints, making functions small by focusing them on one specific thing.\n",
    "- Reproducibility - use virtual environments (I use poetry to manages my environments and packages), set a random seed for reproducing results, use logging to track code execution for easier debugging, and using configuration files for project management.\n",
    "- Version Control - use Git and GitHub to track changes and store code, track experiments using Mlflow or Weights & Biases, version data using DVC (Data Version Control), make small code commits to easily track changes, and create Git branches to develop code before reviewing and committing to main (usually done as part of a established code review process).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Scalability & adaptability. This point extends beyond the initial research phase of the project to plan for how the project could scale in a production environment. The key considerations here relate to what technologies can we use to manage scalable compute resources and documenting model artifacts, as well as can model improvements be made in production without server downtime so the user experience isn't impacted?

    "Now our data set has been identified, we need to understand how we intend to collect, store and process the data. This process is commonly referred to as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). This is where good coding skills in Python and SQL come into play to automate the preparation of data for downstream analytics. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Extract. Collecting the data is usually straight forward once the sources have been identified. The World Bank data source can be accessed via a downloadable CSV file or an API. Once we've collected the raw data, we need to validate it and make sure it conforms to our business requirements, if not then notifications should be sent to teh sources so they can make appropriate changes. The accepted data can be uploaded it to our database to keep track of the raw data or it can be sent through to the transform stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Transform. In a research setting, this is often done as part of the data exploration stage to investigate the data for signal to see if it can be used to solve our problem. In a production environment, because vast amounts of data can be generated the cleaning of data needs to be automated. Data cleaning can involve joining datasets, recoding values, standardising features, imputation, feature mutation and introducing business logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Load. The transformed data is then written out as a file, database or data warehouse such as Google BigQuery, Snowflake or Amazon S3. "
